Group events.
     - should specify arrow color
     
State_model -- more docs

Time class.

Undockability.

Use shared_ptr<>

Stock method to show tabular detailed information?

Base class for freestanding tools?




  - Use either QVector (by-value) or std::vector by reference in all interfaces.
  
   - Use private virtual methods everywhere.

  - Preserve the component selection on each level? Or rather find out how it seem
    to work now?

  - Should store the parents stack?

  - Fix up the event selection in find dialog.

  - Fix up memory management for trace models. We leak like crazy at
    the moment.

  - Events to "buble up" to parent components.

  - More What's this texts.

  - Check again that clipping of component names againts 
    component rects works.

  - Set limits for zoom in.

  - Filtering of send/recieve event should filter out arrows as well.

  - Robustify model restore code, especially in face of new components
    or event types.
  
  - It's hard to hit exactly on the check mark, and hitting outside
    won't change check status.

  - The "Measure" segfaults when just one component is selected.

  - Limit the numbers of event shown, and display an error
    message is the limit is exceeded.

  - Set better size hint for the table?

  - FIXME: filter_components must be the last call, otherwise
    we'll reinitialize subcomponents array and boom.

  - Change in model should update everything


  - Render "root" component in a different style, to avoid confusing
    it with real components.

  - Handle enter press inside spin box that is used to specify max time?

  - Make 'set start' actually work.

  - Tune the pixel distance where we show events. And remove hardcode.

  - Add 'isActive' method in the base controlling widget class.
